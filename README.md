# Hands-On Assistant

- [Slide for Google Assistant](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12_m04yZxrue1oUDJddaCfJd_UAuNDPkzlTOhK716-YY)
- [Slide for Alexa](https://docs.google.com/a/xebia.fr/presentation/d/11HKDcjdbRxAitrWZTK16DXYEEOePF50e3QWepv34e8o)

## Get Started

- [Google Assistant](google-assistant/README.md)
- [Amazon Alexa](amazon-alexa/README.md)

There will be enough time to finish both hands-on. But if you are more interested 
by one of the platforms and want to go further, it's totally fine.

> Attention: At the time of writing, Google Assistant currently supports English (U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia), 
French, German, and Japanese. Alexa currently supports English (Australia, Canada, India, UK, US), 
German and Japanese. 

## Extra Fun

For this Hands-On, some other widgets are available if you want to try to manipulate 
connected objects with Google Assistant & Alexa:

- Several [Philips Hue](https://www2.meethue.com/en-us) lightbulbs (Thanks Pablo :D)
- A Raspberry Pi 3 
- A NXP Pico i.MX7D Android Things Kit
